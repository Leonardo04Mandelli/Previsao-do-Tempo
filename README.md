Semi-Finished // 
Weather Forecast Project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Used the OpenWeatherMap API.
The user simply needs to type the name of a city and click on the search icon, which will display information such as climate, temperature and humidity.
A bug with the API time icons still needs to be fixed. Otherwise everything is working. I will update the project soon.
